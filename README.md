The .MOV project provides an interactive film platform that allows you to view films, search for them and retrieve detailed information about each film. The application uses a public [API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) to display films and includes features such as a slider for current trending films, a search bar and a detailed view of each film. Users can also navigate between different genres and view a list of films categorized by genre.

The application was developed as a team effort using React and utilizes a user-friendly navigation. It includes a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and a clearly structured user interface.

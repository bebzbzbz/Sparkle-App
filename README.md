The WhoCares Application presents a social media platform that allows its users to create personalized profiles and share photos and their thoughts connected to them. Users are able to engage in the community by following each other, liking and commenting on other people's posts, as well as revisiting the posts they liked by viewing them in the favorites page.

The application was created as a group effort of four at the final of our 6-month long Frontend Web Development Bootcamp, using React in the Front- and Supabase in the Backend.
